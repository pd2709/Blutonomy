Hello team!! 

ðŸ™‚ Start each day off right

Begin every day by pulling or fetching from the master to your local master.

  -> Pulling will automatically try to merge the recent commits from master and throw errors if there are any conflicts

  -> Fetching will gather the most recent commits in a branch which you can then view and decide to merge or not

  -> Once you have all the most recent updates on your master you can then merge those changes into your branch:

    git checkout <branch you want to update>

    git merge <branch name youâ€™re merging from>

You may have to handle merge conflicts at this point. Note that files with merge conflicts are usually a different color in the sidebar.

Create a new branch

    git checkout -b <new branch name>

  This branch will start off with a copy of the branch you were on.


ðŸ‘®Clone the New Repository to your Local Machine(s)

  Note: Each team member will need to perform this step.

  On GitHub, navigate to the project repo:

   Press the green Clone or download button.
   Ensure that clone with HTTPS is selected. (If you setup GitHub to use SSH key and passphrase, you may select that option, but these instructions assume you are using HTTPS.)
   Copy the URL provided.

In your local terminal, from the top level folder under which you want to place your repo:

    $ git clone paste-copied-url-here
